# Identify all contracts
for contract in contracts:
    if contract == "Service Agreement":
        # Identify parameters for Service Agreement
        for parameter in service_agreement_parameters:
            print(f"{parameter}: {service_agreement_parameters[parameter]}")
    elif contract == "Purchase Order":
        # Identify parameters for Purchase Order
        for parameter in purchase_order_parameters:
            print(f"{parameter}: {purchase_order_parameters[parameter]}")
    elif contract == "Non-Disclosure Agreement":
        # Identify parameters for Non-Disclosure Agreement
        for parameter in non_disclosure_agreement_parameters:
            print(f"{parameter}: {non_disclosure_agreement_parameters[parameter]}")
    else:
        print("Contract not recognized.")
This code will iterate over each contract in the contracts list and check if it matches one of the three contracts that we have parameters for: "Service Agreement", "Purchase Order", or "Non-Disclosure Agreement". If it does, the code will then iterate over each parameter for that contract and print out the parameter name and value.

Here are the identified parameters for each contract:

Service recipient: XYZ Corp.

Duration of agreement: 3 years what is this referring to And has that applied to my insurance in FT program or my solar panel program or my lemonade or my average program
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure what you're referring to. The code I provided is a Python code that iterates over contracts and prints out parameters for each contract. It doesn't have any reference to insurance, solar panel program, lemonade, or average program. Could you please provide more context or information about what you're asking?
