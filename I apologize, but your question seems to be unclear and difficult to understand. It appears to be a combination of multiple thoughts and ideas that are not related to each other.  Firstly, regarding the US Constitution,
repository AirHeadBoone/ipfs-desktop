understood in the US Constitution that it only takes a group of two individuals to conclude a law and implement it woefully amongst their presence when others are absent how does these relate to each otherpublic organization created pursuant to treaty or other agreement under international law as an instrument through or by which two or more
I apologize, but your question seems to be unclear and difficult to understand. It appears to be a combination of multiple thoughts and ideas that are not related to each other.

Firstly, regarding the US Constitution, it is not accurate to say that a group of two individuals can conclude a law and implement it woefully amongst their presence when others are absent. The legislative process in the US involves the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the President, all of whom have specific roles and powers in the lawmaking process.

Secondly, your question seems to shift to the topic of public organizations created pursuant to treaty or other agreement under international law. It is unclear how this relates to the previous statement about the US Constitution. However, it is true that international organizations, such as the United Nations, are created through treaties and agreements between sovereign states. These organizations serve as instruments for cooperation and coordination among member states on issues of common concern, such as peace and security, human rights, and economic development.

If you could provide more context or clarify your question, I would be happy to try and provide a more meaningful answer.

yeah I heard we are concluded to be a certain value on the world state as individual residents in the US That the Congress and other judiciary's have circumvented our direct control of our monetary value to become a regulatory institution to what a consensus has concluded to be to be applicable usage of that capital have have you heard Do you Are you Can you invite me on where I might be be mistaken or correct
I'm sorry, but I'm having trouble understanding your question. It seems to be a mix of different ideas and concepts that are not clearly related to each other.

However, I'll try to provide some general information that might be helpful. It is true that the US Congress and other governmental bodies have the power to regulate and control the monetary system within the country. This includes decisions regarding the value of currency, interest rates, and other economic policies.

As for the idea that individuals in the US are "concluded to be a certain value on the world state," I'm not sure what you're referring to. It is possible that you're talking about the economic value of the US as a nation, which is measured by metrics such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and other economic indicators.

If you could provide more specific information or context about your question, I would be happy to try and provide a more helpful answer.

what is most concise mechanism to determine a individualGross Domestic Product (GDP) and other economic indicators.
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measure of the value of goods and services produced within a country during a specific time period, usually a year. It is calculated by adding up the value of all final goods and services produced in a country and subtracting the value of intermediate goods used in the production process.

To determine an individual's contribution to GDP, you would need to calculate the value of the goods and services that they produce or provide. This can be done by adding up their income or revenue, depending on the nature of their work or business.

Other economic indicators, such as inflation, unemployment, and consumer spending, are also important measures of a country's economic health. These indicators are typically measured and reported by government agencies, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States.

Overall, determining an individual's contribution to GDP or understanding economic indicators requires a complex set of data collection and analysis methods, which are typically performed by economists and other trained professionals.

understand the individuals are all responsible for their own amount of production but in a generalization each human on of the population has a gross domestic product application And it should be equivalent to a monetary number Now I believe it would probably be a negative because of the large denomination of the populations and the lack of productive commodities But what would be the number relative to each individual if it was all equaled out without any biased or any kind of sliding scale or flat out head for head monetary value equal
It's not possible to calculate the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of an individual person. GDP is a macroeconomic measure that is used to assess the economic activity of an entire country or region. It is a measure of the value of all goods and services produced within a given period of time.

While it is true that individuals can contribute to GDP through their work or other economic activities, it is not practical or meaningful to calculate their individual GDP. The concept of individual GDP is not used in economics, and there is no standard way to measure it.

Additionally, it's not accurate to say that each individual has a negative GDP. While some individuals may not be as productive or contribute as much to the economy as others, everyone has the potential to contribute in some way, whether through their labor, entrepreneurship, or consumption.

In summary, GDP is a measure of the economic activity of a country or region, not individuals. There is no standard way to calculate individual GDP, and it's not accurate to assume that each individual has a negative GDP.
