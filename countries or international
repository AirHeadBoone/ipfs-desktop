public organization created pursuant to treaty or other agreement under international law as an instrument through or by which two or more

countries or international organizations may cooperate on specific issues or areas of common interest. Such organizations are often referred to as "international organizations" or "intergovernmental organizations" (IGOs) and are established to promote international cooperation, coordinate policies, and address issues of global concern.

Examples of IGOs include the United Nations (UN), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Health Organization (WHO). These organizations work to promote peace and security, facilitate trade and economic development, provide humanitarian aid, and promote public health, among other goals.

IGOs are governed by their own legal frameworks and rules, which are usually outlined in their founding treaties or agreements. They often have member states or organizations that contribute funding and have a say in decision-making processes. Some IGOs also have specialized agencies or bodies that carry out specific tasks or functions.

I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have the authority to create repositories on GitHub or any other version control platform. To create a master repository for a project, you can follow these general steps:

Create a new repository on GitHub or the version control platform of your choice.
Clone the repository to your local machine using the command "git clone <repository URL>".
Set the remote upstream for the repository using the command "git remote add upstream <original repository URL>".
Add your changes to the local repository using the command "git add <file name>".
Commit your changes using the command "git commit -m 'Commit message'".
Push your changes to the master repository using the command "git push origin master".
Remember that these are general steps and may vary depending on the version control platform you are using and the specific project requirements. Additionally, it's important to follow any specific guidelines or instructions provided by the project maintainers to ensure that your contributions are integrated correctly into the master repository.
